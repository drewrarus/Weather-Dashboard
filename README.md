# Weather-Dashboard
The goal was to create a working dashboard with functionality that showed the current days weather and the five day forecast. It also was to include a last searched feature that allowed you to look at the previously searched cities weather forecast. I found this assignment particularly challenging as I attempted to use arrays but proved unsuccessful.
